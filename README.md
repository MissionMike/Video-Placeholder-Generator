# Video-Placeholder-Generator-Client
Front-end utility to generate a video placeholder image, especially useful for embedding in HTML email.

Paste in a YouTube or Vimeo URL, set options (or use defaults), then copy the resulting URL to use in your email campaigns.

**Note: It is recommended to build your own instance of this utility, as well set up the [https://github.com/MissionMike/Video-Placeholder-Generator-Server](server-side installation) to host your own thumbnails. Perpetual hosting on the default api.missionmike.dev domain is NOT guaranteed!**

Customizable options include:
* Thumbnail Width
* Play Button Image (from URL)
* Play Button Width
* Play Button Opacity

More to come!
